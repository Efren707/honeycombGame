# Background

This game based on the honeycomb game from the show squid games. 
The game plays out with having a user carve out a given shape using the mouse tracing the border. 
To start the game the user will click inside the border and will have drag cursor until it has completely traced the whole shape.
There will be a timer so a user has to complete the level within a certain given time frame.
When there is less than 10 seconds left the time turns red
A user will lose if the cursor goes out of bounds, or if time is up. 
The game will have 4 levels increasing in difficulty of the shape that needs to be traced out.
